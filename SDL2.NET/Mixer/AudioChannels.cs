// I really tried to encapsulate these methods into an object, but I couldn't really figure out how.
// The entire API is very dependant on a state that is not only hidden away from me, but would require a lot of work (and not insignificant CPU) to
// manage and keep track of, and it seems wasteful considering SDL already does it.
// Any object or state I could create here would be simply unable to make any sort of guarantees to the users, channels could stop, start, resume, fadeOut, change groups
// and do any number of things at any given time at the user's bequest; and it would probably be bloat to keep track of all that in .NET, not to mention memory bloat for
// all the objects and lists that would be created for every group and channel. So, user, I leave this to you.
