# SDL2.NET
### <b>This library is still in early alpha!</b>
#### But it's currently in a usable state, I invite you to use it, test it out, and perhaps even do a couple of PRs!
#### Please read the [Installation Docs](https://github.com/DiegoG1019/SDL2.NET/tree/main/Installation%20Docs)
#### Refer to [SDL2.NET Tests](https://github.com/DiegoG1019/SDL2.NET/tree/main/SDL2.NET%20Tests) for an example on how to use this library

Bringing SDL2 into .NET with its code styles and best practices. Based on https://github.com/flibitijibibo/SDL2-CS (and/or https://github.com/ppy/SDL2-CS) and forked from https://github.com/DoogeJ/SDL2Example
There are probably a lot of beginner mistakes in this; feel free to point them out to me.

Library project [MIT License](LICENSE.md). All used external libraries, binaries, resources under their respective licenses as listed here or stored in the [lib](lib) folder.

### Requirements:
* This is a .NET 6 application: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0

### A Request!
* Anyone with experience developing interoping apps with C#, I'd be very thankful for a solution for, or help in solving the issue of including SDL's binaries for other platforms into the library as well -- potentially in a form that would allow for multiple NuGet packages?

### Hints and tips:
* Check the comments in [SDL2Example.csproj](SDL2Example.csproj)
* If you use VS Code, set the program path in launch.json to the executable (not dll), for example `${workspaceFolder}/bin/Debug/net6.0/SDL2Example.exe` or external resources will not load properly when debugging
