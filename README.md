# SDL2Example
Very basic .NET 6 (C#) SDL2 example application.
There are probably a lot of beginner mistakes in this; feel free to point them out to me.

Example project under [MIT License](LICENSE.md). All used external libraries, binaries, resources under their respective licenses as listed here or stored in the [lib](lib) folder.

### Requirements:
* This is a .NET 6 application: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0

### Hints and tips:
* Check the comments in [SDL2Example.csproj](SDL2Example.csproj)
* If you use VS Code, set the program path in launch.json to the executable (not dll), for example `${workspaceFolder}/bin/Debug/net6.0/SDL2Example.exe` or external resources will not load properly when debugging
